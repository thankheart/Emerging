      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <p>
        We aim to address the burden of domestic labor through accessible,
        humanoid robot solutions.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our project explores the possibilities of humanoid robots to ease the
        workload of domestic caregivers, enhance efficiency, and offer
        consistent support for daily household tasks. By integrating advanced
        AI, these robots can perform various tasks with precision, ultimately
        improving the quality of life for elderly users and primary caregivers.

      <p>
        This project investigates how humanoid robots can assist with domestic
        tasks, aiming to alleviate the significant burden of care and household
        management that falls disproportionately on women and elderly
        individuals. Our vision includes AI-driven robots that reduce daily
        workload, improve independence, and foster a healthier work-life balance
        for primary caregivers.
